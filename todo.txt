Scope
- Basic voxel editing with subtractive, additive editing, coloring
- Undo/Redo system
- Basic diffuse material; should be able to change transparency probably.
- Serializable structures that can be exported and imported
- Basic, ambient occlusion, shadowing based on IQ's shaders

Initial Vision
- Simple editor with Blender-like grid; gradient background like in your ShaderToy voxel demos.

** Graphics: Look at optifine shader source code!

Todo
[ ] Grid fixed, but need to rethink math necessary to get zoom to work when 
    raymarching and fix picking.
[ ] Voxels are no perfectly cubical when changing zoom level.
[ ] Trying to add voxels to empty chunk currently does not work due to CPU-side raycast
		logic.

[ ] Antialiasing
[ ] Nicer lighting
[ ] Performance isn't great even at low resolution. Optimize shader.

[ ] Crashes on release

[ ] Cleanup
		- increase granularity of rendering
		- maybe make granularity of updating and drawing per-chunk
		- rework uniform data: don't duplicate calculations on cpu/gpu, upload parameters.
		- instead of using VOX_UniformData in several places, you can just use that struct
			when uploading data to shader and do something like VOX_ViewParameters or something.
			when you need to populate uniform data, just use fields from view parameters and
			wherever else it needs to come from.

[ ] Bugs
    - Picking ray seems to be slightly off from mouse... 

[X] Editing modes: add and delete

[ ] Lighting pass pt. 2: AO, shadows
[ ] Antialiasing, tonemapping

[ ] Brush size
[ ] Basic color and opacity selection 

[ ] Serialization, undo system

[ ] Polish:
 - Make fov adjustable
 - Lerp between zoom transitions

[ ] Cleanup and knowledge refresher pass over all code
